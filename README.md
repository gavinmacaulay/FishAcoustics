This repository contains Python code that does various things of value to fisheries acoustics:

- Plots echosounder near-field ranges ([plot_transducer_near_fields.py](acoustics/plot_transducer_near_fields.py))
- Implements the phase-tracking distorted wave Born approximation ([dwba.py](dwba/dwba.py))
- Loads a LSSS database export file into a Pandas DataFrame ([read_lsss_db_export.py](lsss/read_lsss_db_export.py))
- Calculates acoustic absorption in seawater using various published formulae ([sw_absorption.py](seawater/sw_absorption.py))

Pull requests, comments, and bug reports are welcome.

Use at your own risk and responsibility.
