This repository contains Python code that provides various things of value to fisheries acoustics studies:

- Plots echosounder near-field ranges ([plot_transducer_near_fields.py](src/acoustics/plot_transducer_near_fields.py))
- Implements the phase-tracking distorted wave Born approximation ([dwba.py](src/dwba/dwba.py))
- Utility functions to work with some Echoview files
- Utility functions work with some LSSS files
- Calculates acoustic absorption in seawater using various published formulae ([sw_absorption.py](src/seawater/sw_absorption.py))

Pull requests, comments, and bug reports are welcome.
